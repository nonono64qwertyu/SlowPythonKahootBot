SlowPythonKahootBot
A kahoot bot written in python that is stupidly slow and bad

Goal:
- I know about a billion kahoot bots exist already, but from boredom I have decided to try to make my own in python.

Requirements:

- Selenium --> "pip3 install selenium"
- Add the the directory of ChromeDriver.exe to PATH. --> This if you're on windows, if you're on something else, I don't know what you have to do.

How to run:
If you're on Windows, run run.bat, on linux or Mac, just run from the command interface: "python main.py"


Plans:
-I want to find an alternative way to interact with kahoot, other than Selenium, because it is slow, for this purpose at least.
